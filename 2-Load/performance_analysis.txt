AC: 
It's expected that this service must support 75 users at any given moment and must be able to handle 350 requests per second. 
The response time must be under 200 ms.

Results:
AC seems too optimistic since the results were worse
throughput: 269 requests /s
Response time avg: 277 > 200 
session times: 15-60m

it is recommended to improve server capacity, since for 75 users it is unlikely that any other issue could affect the results as much like latency/network/others.
